Zombie Escape
=============

Zombie Escape is a popular gamemode for Counter-Strike: Source, now available for Garry's Mod. Players initially spawn as humans, and after a short amount of time, an infection outbreaks. The humans must escape the infection by reaching the end of the map, otherwise the zombies will succeed. Humans are able to 'push' zombies back with their bullets. Each weapon has their own stats, which affects the amount of push.

#### Map Patching ####
Included with the gamemode is a custom tool, which I originally created for Sassilization, for patching Zombie Escape maps, found under 'ZombieEscape/content/MapPatcher.exe' (Your anti-virus may tell you that it is malware, but I assure you, it is not). Unfortunately, a number of maps for the gamemode feature bugs only found present in Garry's Mod. A certain grated material is handled differently, bullets go through it in Garry's Mod, but not in Counter-Strike: Source. The tool provides instructions for correcting this by clicking the 'Help' link. Technical details: The tool parses the brush lump of a map and removes the CONTENTS_GRATE attribute from any surface with that attribute. More details can be found ([here](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_BSP_File_Format#Brush_and_brushside).
